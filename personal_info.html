                <p><span><strong>Hi! My name is B*****, and I currently major in science.</strong></span></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span><strong>Hobbies: One of my favorite hobbies is baking because it helps me wind down after
                                a long week. </strong></span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Favorites: My favorite color is brown, I adore cats over any animal, and my
                                favorite dessert is cookies/macaroons.</strong></span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Favorite website: My favorite website is YouTube.com because I can learn so much
                                and entertain&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>myself at the same time.</strong></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Favorite technology: My favorite technology would be the phone. The basic answer
                                is that the phone is one of the most useful devices ever made by
                                mankind.</strong></span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>I strongly dislike chocolate flavored foods üëéüèæ</strong></span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Travel/If I were to spend a semester: If I could spend a semester and where in the
                                world it would be in either </strong></span><strong>Switzerland, Canc√∫n/Tropical area near the beach, London, or
                            California. These would also be the selections I choose if the question was "If you were to
                            travel anywhere right now, where would it be?"</strong></li>
